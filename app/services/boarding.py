"""The rotating boarding QR: what it contains, and what makes one valid.

Spec §7.2. The code a student shows is:

    ticket_id · passenger_count · time_slice · nonce · signature

signed with the ticket's Ed25519 private key. It re-signs every 30 seconds, so
a screenshot passed to a friend is worthless within half a minute.

Four independent things have to hold for a boarding to be accepted, and each
closes a different attack:

1. **Signature** — proves the code came from a device holding that ticket's
   private key. Without it anyone could type a ticket id into a QR generator.
2. **Time slice** — proves it was made *recently*. Without it a signature,
   once captured, is a season ticket.
3. **Nonce** — proves this particular code has not already been used. Without
   it one valid 30-second window boards a whole queue.
4. **Ticket state** — active, in date, rides remaining.

Verification runs identically on the server and, once the Flutter side lands,
on a helper's phone with no signal — which is the entire point of §7.5. So
nothing here reads the database or the clock beyond what it is handed.

# their own key out of the app can sign whatever number they like.
