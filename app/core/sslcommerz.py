"""SSLCommerz payment gateway client.

Two calls, and the difference between them is the whole security model:

1. **Session init** (`/gwprocess/v4/api.php`) — we post the order and get back a
   `GatewayPageURL`. The student is sent there to pay.
2. **Validation** (`/validator/api/validationserverAPI.php`) — we ask SSLCommerz,
   server to server, what actually happened to a `val_id`.

**Nothing the browser tells us is trusted.** The student returns from the
gateway to `success_url` carrying a `val_id`, but that redirect is just an HTTP
request anyone can forge by typing a URL. It is only a hint that something may
have happened. The ticket is issued on the strength of step 2 — a direct call to
SSLCommerz authenticated with the store password, whose response we compare
against the order's own amount and currency.

That comparison matters as much as the call. A validation response that says
`VALID` for 1.00 BDT against a 100.00 BDT order is a successful attack if you
only check the status field.

The store password is a credential. It lives in the environment, never in the
repository, and never leaves this module — it is not logged and not returned to
any client.
