"""Payment reconciler (spec §9) — the job that finds money nobody told us about.

An order settles when someone reports the payment: the student's browser coming
back, or SSLCommerz's IPN. Both can fail to arrive. The tab gets closed on a
train, the phone dies, the IPN lands while the API is being redeployed. When
neither shows up the student has paid and holds nothing, and no amount of
retrying on their part fixes it — there is no request left to make.

So this asks the other way round. For every order still unsettled, it queries
SSLCommerz using the `tran_id` we generated ourselves, which needs nothing but
our own records. If the gateway says the money moved, the ticket is issued now,
late but correct.

Two thresholds shape it:

- `GRACE_S` — how long to leave a fresh order alone. A student takes a minute
  or two on the gateway's page, and an order queried mid-payment reports
  nothing useful.
- `ABANDON_H` — when to stop asking. An order the gateway has never heard of
  after this long was never paid; the student opened checkout and walked away.
  Leaving those `pending` forever would bury the real discrepancies.

The dangerous direction here is issuing a ticket that was not paid for, so
every settlement goes through the same `apply_validation` the request handlers
use — including the amount check. A reconciler that trusted the gateway's
status alone would be a way to buy a monthly pass for one taka.

    `initiated` and `pending` are the obvious ones. `failed` and `cancelled` are
    included too, but **only when `raw_payload` is NULL**, and that condition is
    the whole point:

    `raw_payload` is written in exactly one place — `apply_validation`, after a
    server-to-server validation call. So a NULL payload on a closed order means
    it was closed from the unverified `status` field that SSLCommerz POSTs to the
    return and IPN handlers, and nothing ever checked that claim against the
    gateway.

    That matters because a transaction can carry several attempts: a declined
    card followed by a successful wallet. If the declined attempt's report lands
    first, `_settle` marks the order `failed`. Were this query to trust that, the
    order would drop out of the reconciler's reach forever — and if the success
    report then went missing (a closed tab, a dropped IPN) the money would be
    gone with no ticket and nothing left to notice it.

    A genuinely abandoned checkout costs one gateway query per pass until
    `ABANDON_H`, which then closes it for good. That is a cheap price for not
    silently keeping someone's money.
