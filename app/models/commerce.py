"""Tickets and the money that buys them (spec §6 "Commerce").

Three tables, in the order a purchase moves through them:

    ticket_products   what is for sale
    orders            one attempt to buy, paid or not
    tickets           what the student actually holds afterwards

The split matters. A failed payment must leave a record — reconciliation
depends on being able to see "money left the student, no ticket exists" — so
orders are never deleted and never mutated into tickets.

**Gateway-neutral naming.** The spec was written around bKash PGW; the
integration is SSLCommerz, which is an aggregator that offers bKash as one
channel among cards and other wallets. Columns are therefore named for the role
they play (`gateway`, `gateway_tran_id`, `gateway_val_id`) rather than for a
provider, because the provider has already changed once.

Money is stored in **paisa** as an integer, never as a float. 100.00 BDT is
10000. Floating-point cannot represent 0.1 exactly, and a rounding error in a
ledger is a bug you find months later in a reconciliation report.
