"""Boarding: QR material for students, the manifest and redemptions for helpers.

Three endpoints, one per side of a boarding (spec §7.2, §7.5):

    GET  /shop/tickets/{id}/qr-material   student's device learns to sign
    GET  /helper/manifest                 helper's device learns to verify
    POST /helper/redemptions              helper reports what it accepted

The asymmetry is the security model. A student receives a **private** key and
can therefore only ever produce codes for tickets they own. A helper receives
**public** keys and can therefore only verify, never forge — so a stolen helper
phone, which carries the whole fleet's manifest, is worth nothing.
