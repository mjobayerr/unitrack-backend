"""Router aggregation and the public-route allow-list.

Adding an endpoint means touching this file in exactly one of two ways:

- New router? Include it in `api_router` below. Guard it at the `APIRouter(...)`
  constructor — see `admin.py`.
- Genuinely public route (no login possible or required)? Add its path to
  `PUBLIC_PATHS`.

Anything else fails `tests/test_auth_coverage.py`, which walks the mounted app
and refuses any route that is neither guarded nor listed here. Forgetting to
guard a route is the single easiest security mistake to make in FastAPI, so it
is a build failure rather than a code-review hope.
