"""Auth guards. Every protected endpoint in this API goes through here.

Read this before adding a route — `app/api/routes/admin.py` is the worked
example.

The shape of it
---------------
    get_principal          resolve the bearer token -> Principal (who is this?)
      └─ require(...)      assert role / helper approval  (may they?)

`require()` is a *factory*: call it with the roles a route needs and it hands
back a FastAPI dependency. Attach that to a whole router and every route inside
it is guarded by construction — including the one a teammate adds next month
without reading this file.

Cost of a guard
---------------
Roughly free. FastAPI caches each dependency's result per request, so stacking
`require(admin)` on the router and `get_principal` in the handler resolves the
token **once**, not twice. The token check is an HS256 verify (~10 µs) plus one
Redis GET (~0.15 ms); Postgres is touched only on a cache miss. Never hand-roll
your own token parsing in a handler — you would pay the cost again and drift
from this logic.

    Args:
        *roles: allowed roles. Empty means "any authenticated user".
        approved_helper: also demand `helpers.status = 'approved'` (spec §8).
            Helpers self-register as `pending`, so any route that trusts a
            helper's data needs this — a pending account must not be able to
            push GPS fixes.

            route is specifically part of onboarding an inactive account.

        router = APIRouter(
            prefix="/admin",
            dependencies=[Depends(require(UserRole.admin))],
        )

    Roles are read from the **database snapshot, never from the JWT `role`
    claim**. A token minted before a demotion still carries the old role; the
    snapshot does not. Authorization decisions must not trust the token beyond
    the subject it identifies.
