# Authentication & authorization

Every endpoint in this API is authenticated and authorized unless it appears in
`PUBLIC_PATHS` ([`app/api/routes/__init__.py`](../app/api/routes/__init__.py)).
That is enforced by a test, not by convention —
[`tests/test_auth_coverage.py`](../tests/test_auth_coverage.py) fails the build
for any route that is neither guarded nor explicitly listed.

Worked example to copy: [`app/api/routes/admin.py`](../app/api/routes/admin.py).

## Adding a secured endpoint

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from app.api.deps import require_admin

router = APIRouter(prefix="/reports", dependencies=[Depends(require_admin)])

@router.get("/revenue")          # already admin-only; no auth code needed here
async def revenue(): ...
```

Then add `router` to `ROUTERS` in `app/api/routes/__init__.py`. Done.

Guard it on the **router**, not the route. Routes added later inherit it
automatically — which is the case that actually bites, because nobody re-reads
this document before adding an endpoint.

### The available guards

| Guard | Requires |
|---|---|
| `require_authenticated` | any signed-in, active account |
| `require_student` | `role = student` |
| `require_admin` | `role = admin` |
| `require_approved_helper` | `role = helper` **and** `helpers.status = approved` |
| `require(...)` | build your own — roles, `approved_helper`, `active_only` |

Need the caller's identity in the handler? Declare the same guard as a
parameter. It is free — FastAPI caches dependency results per request.

```python
async def create_thing(admin: Principal = Depends(require_admin)): ...
```

## The request flow

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
        │
        ▼
  HTTPBearer            extract the token, 401 if the header is absent/malformed
        │
        ▼
  decode_token(         HS256 verify, exp check, and — critically —
    expected_type=      reject anything that is not an *access* token
    "access")           (a 30-day refresh token must not open a 15-min door)
        │
        ▼
  get_principal_cached  Redis GET authz:principal:{user_id}      ~0.15 ms
        │  miss ─────►  one LEFT JOIN over users + helpers       ~1–2 ms
        │               then SET with a 300 s TTL
        ▼
  Principal             user_id · role · status · helper_id · helper_status
        │
        ▼
  require(...)          403 if status is not active, role is not allowed,
        │               or the route needs an approved helper and this is not
        ▼
  your handler          runs only for a caller who has already passed all of it
```

`get_principal` is the only place a token is parsed. Never decode one in a
handler.

## Why it is fast

The obvious implementation queries Postgres on every request — two round trips,
~1–2 ms, to re-read rows that change maybe twice in an account's lifetime.
`POST /helper/gps` fires every 5 s per bus, and the live-map WebSocket will be
heavier, so that cost is paid tens of thousands of times a day.

| Step | Cost |
|---|---|
| HS256 verify | ~10 µs |
| Redis GET (cache hit) | ~0.15 ms |
| Postgres LEFT JOIN (cache miss) | ~1–2 ms |

At a ~99 % hit rate the auth path averages ~0.16 ms — roughly 10× cheaper than
querying every time, and the miss path is itself one query instead of two.

Stacked guards cost nothing extra. `require_admin` on the router plus
`Depends(require_admin)` in the handler resolves the token **once**: FastAPI
caches each dependency's result for the duration of a request.

Argon2 runs only at `/auth/login`. It is deliberately slow (~100 ms) and must
never appear on a per-request path.

## Why revocation still works

Caching authorization data usually means stale authorization data. Here it does
not, because correctness comes from **explicit invalidation**, not from the TTL:

> Any code path that writes to `users` or `helpers` calls
> `invalidate_principal(r, user_id)` after its commit.

Suspend an account and the next request re-reads the snapshot from Postgres,
sees `suspended`, and 401s. The user's access token is still cryptographically
valid — nothing can un-issue a JWT — but it no longer resolves to a usable
principal.

The 300 s TTL is only a backstop for changes made outside the API, like a manual
`UPDATE` in psql or a seed script.

**If you write an endpoint that mutates `users` or `helpers` and skip the
invalidation, you have written a security bug**: a suspended account keeps
working for up to five minutes. It is one cheap, idempotent `DEL`. When in
doubt, call it.

## Rules

| Rule | Reason |
|---|---|
| Guard the router, not the route | New routes inherit it |
| Pin `algorithms=[ALGORITHM]` | Blocks `alg: none` and HS/RS confusion |
| Always check the `type` claim | Stops refresh tokens being used as access tokens |
| Authorize from `Principal`, never the JWT `role` claim | A token minted before a demotion still carries the old role |
| `invalidate_principal()` after every user/helper write | Revocation depends on it |
| Same 401 for every auth failure | Distinguishing them tells an attacker which half of the guess was right |
| `JWT_SECRET` from env, never a literal | A committed default is a permanent backdoor |

## Known gaps

Not yet built, in priority order:

1. **Refresh tokens are neither rotated nor revocable.** `POST /auth/refresh`
   issues a new pair, but the old refresh token stays valid until its 30-day
   `exp`. A stolen refresh token is 30 days of access, and logout is impossible.
   Fix: a `jti` claim plus a Redis denylist (`revoked:{jti}`, TTL = remaining
   `exp`). Redis is already wired.
2. **No `/auth/logout`** — follows from 1.
3. **No rate limit on `/auth/login`** — brute force runs at network speed.
4. No `iss` / `aud` claims. Low priority for a single-audience system.
