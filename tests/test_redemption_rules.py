"""When a scanned code becomes a deducted ride, and when it must not.

The interesting cases are all consequences of offline boarding. Two helper
phones with no signal cannot see each other's redemption logs, so the same code
can genuinely be accepted twice before either syncs. Cryptography cannot prevent
that — only recording it can — and how the server reacts decides whether a
passenger gets charged twice for one boarding, and whether an admin ever finds
out it happened.
