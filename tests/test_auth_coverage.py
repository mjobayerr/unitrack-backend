This walks the real mounted app and asserts every route either resolves
`get_principal` somewhere in its dependency tree, or is explicitly listed in
`PUBLIC_PATHS`. Adding an endpoint and forgetting the guard turns into a failing
test, not a silent hole in production.

Needs no database, no Redis, no network — it inspects the dependency graph
